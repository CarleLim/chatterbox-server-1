# Chatterbox-Server

This project was a sprint I completed as a student during my time at Hack Reactor Remote. This project was completed with a pair and focused on creating a server using only node.js, no express. 

The client side was also a sprint I completed with a pair at an earlier stage of Hack Reactor Remote.
